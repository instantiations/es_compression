# ES Compression: A Compression Framework for Dart

## Description
Compression framework for Dart providing FFI implementations for Brotli, Lz4, Zstd (Zstandard) with ready-to-use prebuilt binaries
for Win/Linux/Mac.

This work is an inspired port of the *Unified Compression Framework* from the [VAST Platform] (VA Smalltalk) language
and development environment. 

See the [Design Document](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/blob/master/doc/design_doc.md) for detailed
information on how this package was designed and implemented.

Below is a simple example of what an encode/decode would look like:
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:es_compression/brotli.dart';
import 'package:es_compression/lz4.dart';
import 'package:es_compression/zstd.dart';

/// Brotli, Lz4, Zstd usage example
void main() {
  final bytes = utf8.encode('Hello Dart');
  for (final codec in [brotli, lz4, zstd]) {
    final encoded = codec.encode(bytes);
    final decoded = codec.decode(encoded);
    print(utf8.decode(decoded));
  }
}
```

## Executables
In the `bin` subdirectory, the following executables are provided.

| Executable    | Source                | Description                                            |
| --------------| ----------------------|------------------------------------------------------- |
| `escompress`  | `es_compress.dart`    | Encode/Decode files using brotli, gzip, lz4 and zstd   |

If you want to use escompress on the command line,
install it using `pub global activate`:

```console
> pub global activate es_compression
```

### escompress
`escompress` is a program that will encode/decode files using `brotli`, `gzip`, `lz4` or `zstd`.

The user provides the input and output file names from the command line.
By default, the file extension of either the input or output file name is used to determine which algorithm and
encode/decode mode to use.
The user can provide additional command line arguments to make these decisions explicitly.
Some examples are provided below.

#### Examples

Encode *input.txt* to *output.lz4* using Lz4 compression:
```console
> escompress -i"input.txt" -o"output.lz4"
```

Encode *input.txt* to *output.lz4* using Lz4 compression at compression level 3:
```console
> escompress -l 3 -i"input.txt" -o"output.lz4"
```

Decode *input.brotli* to *output.txt* using Brotli compression:
```console
> escompress -i"input.brotli" -o"output.txt"
```

Encode *input.txt* to *output.compressed* using Zstd compression:
```console
> escompress -e -a zstd -i"input.txt" -o"output.compressed"
```

Decode *input.compressed* to *output.txt* using GZip compression:
```console
> escompress -d -a gzip -i"input.compressed" -o"output.txt"
```

Print help:
```console
> escompress -h
```

## Examples
In the `example` subdirectory, the following examples are provided to demonstrate usage of the converters and the
framework.

| `zstd_benchmark.dart`     | Benchmark encoding/decode of the Zstd FFI-based implementation     |

To run (lz4 shown below):
```console
> dart benchmark/lz4_benchmark.dart
```

## Deployment
FFI-based implementations will need access to the low-level shared libraries (i.e. .dll, .so, .dylib).
This package offers a flexible library loader that can be customized for end-user deployment needs.

By default, the resolution order is:
- Environment Variable
- Package-Relative
- Script-Relative
- OS-Dependent

User Provided Resolution: The user can override the above resolution with a user provided library path. The different
strategies for locating shared libraries are described below.

### Android Deployment Instructions

To use the `es_compression` package on Android, you must ensure that your Android project includes native `.so` libraries for Brotli, Lz4, and Zstd.

#### Steps

1. **Download Prebuilt Android Native Libraries**

   Download the precompiled `.so` files from:  
   [android_lib_es_compression0_9_9 Releases](https://github.com/isong0623/android_lib_es_compression0_9_9/releases)

2. **Rename Library Files**

   Rename each file by adding the `lib` prefix. For example:

   ```
   esbrotli-android64.so → libesbrotli-android64.so
   ```

3. **Place `.so` Files in jniLibs**

   Extract and organize them under `android/app/src/main/jniLibs`:

   ```
   android/app/src/main/jniLibs/
   ├── arm64-v8a/
   │   ├── libesbrotli-android64.so
   │   ├── libeslz4-android64.so
   │   └── libeszstd-android64.so
   ├── armeabi-v7a/
   │   ├── libesbrotli-android32.so
   │   ├── libeslz4-android32.so
   │   └── libeszstd-android32.so
   ├── x86/
   │   ├── libesbrotli-android32.so
   │   ├── libeslz4-android32.so
   │   └── libeszstd-android32.so
   └── x86_64/
       ├── libesbrotli-android64.so
       ├── libeslz4-android64.so
       └── libeszstd-android64.so
   ```

4. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**

   Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following inside the `android` block:

   ```gradle
   android {
       sourceSets {
           main.jniLibs.srcDirs += 'src/main/jniLibs'
       }
       defaultConfig {
           ndk.abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
       }
   }
   ```

Once completed, the `es_compression` package will be fully functional on Android with no manual native compilation required.

These steps have been tested by multiple contributors. Please let us know via [Issues](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/issues) if they work for your setup or need adjustment.

### Environment Variable Resolution
An environment variable can be defined that provides the path to the shared library. This is either the path to the shared
library file or the directory which should contain the filename of the form *es{algo}_{os}{bitness}.{ext}*. For example,
the filename for lz4 on 64-bit windows would be *eslz4_win64.dll*.

| Codec      | Environment Variable  |
| -----------| --------------------- |
| `brotli`   | BROTLI_LIBRARY_PATH   |
| `lz4`      | LZ4_LIBRARY_PATH      |
| `zstd`     | ZSTD_LIBRARY_PATH     |

### Package-Relative Resolution
Prebuilt shared libraries for Win/Linux/Mac are provided in the `blob` directory of each FFI codec implementation. These
have been built by the package maintainer using the [blob_builder](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/tree/master/tool/blob_builder)
tool.

The distributed shared libs for a codec named *'xxx'* is expected to be located in `lib/src/xxx/blobs` by default.

### Script-Relative Resolution
An attempt is made to find the shared library in the same directory as the running script. The name of the shared library
is expected to be of the form *es{algo}_{os}{bitness}.{ext}*. For example, the filename for zstd on 64-bit linux would
be *eszstd_linux64.dll*.

### OS-Dependent Resolution
A call to `DynamicLibrary.open()` is made for the filename of the form *es{algo}_{os}{bitness}.{ext}* which will use
the resolution rules for the operating system.

### User Provided Resolution
Users of this package have the option to override the library path early in the program.

Provided FFI Codecs have static getters/setters for the `libraryPath`. Users should be sure set the `libraryPath`
early **before** the first use. A `StateError` will be thrown if a user attempts to set the `libraryPath` more than once.

```dart
final codec = ZstdCodec.libraryPath = '/path/to/shared/library.so';
```

### Code Signing

#### Windows
Provided dlls are digitally signed with an MS authenticode certificate owned by [Instantiations, Inc].

#### Linux
*N/A*

#### Mac
Provided dylibs are not currently signed, and recent versions of OSX will refuse to load them unless you allow
it from the *Security & Privacy* dialog.

The build scripts have been provided [blob_builder](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/tree/master/tool/blob_builder)
and gives you access to build and sign them yourself, if desired.

*Instantiations may sign the libraries in the future, and if so, it will be noted in the changelog and here.*

## Tools
In the `tool` subdirectory, the following tools are provided.

### Blob Builder
[blob_builder](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/tree/master/tool/blob_builder) is a `cmake`-based build
generator which builds all the prebuilt shared libraries and copies them to their appropriate location in the dart library.

The maintainers use this tool to update the prebuilt shared libraries.
It can also be used to build custom versions of the various libraries by making adjustments to CMake variables that
define the version level information.

Prebuilt shared libraries for Win/Linux/Mac are provided in the `blobs` directory for each FFI codec implementation.
The distributed shared libs for a codec named *xxx* is expected to be located in `lib/src/xxx/blobs`.

There are instructions in the main [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/blob/master/tool/blob_builder/CMakeLists.txt)
file that describe how to run the tool.

## Framework
Initial codecs provided by this library use FFI-based implementations. However, the framework easily allows for pure
dart implementations for use within a front-end web context. [rle_example.dart](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/blob/master/example/rle_example.dart)
shows a simple example of how to accomplish this.

The `GZipCodec` from `dart:io` served as a great starting point for understanding how to put the VAST Platform framework
abstractions in terms of Dart codecs, converters, filters, sinks.

The major compression framework abstractions are:
- `CodecConverter` - Connects the compression framework to `Converter` in `dart:convert`.
- `CodecFilter` - Direct processing of byte data and provides low-level compression implementation and hooks.
- `CodecSink` - A type of `ByteConversionSink` for efficient transmission of byte data.
- `CodecBuffer` - A buffer with a streaming API that is backed by either [native](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/blob/master/lib/src/framework/native/buffers.dart)
or [dart](https://github.com/instantiations/es_compression/blob/master/lib/src/framework/dart/buffers.dart) heap bytes.
