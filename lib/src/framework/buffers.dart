/// An abstract implementation of a streamable buffer useful for implementing
/// codec algorithms.
///
/// # Type Parameter: `T`
/// Type [T] is the "pointer" to the various memory locations in the buffer,
/// such as the base, read and write ptr locations. [T] is usually a
/// `DartHeapPointer` from this library, or the ffi `Pointer` type.
/// However, this can be user defined.
///
/// # Writing:
/// 0..[writeCount] contains the data that has been written to the buffer.
/// The remaining amount is [unwrittenCount].
///
/// # Reading:
/// 0..[readCount] contains the data that has already been read in the buffer.
/// The remaining amount is [unreadCount].
///
/// The buffer is constantly being filled and flushed during usage by codecs.
/// It internally keeps track of how many total bytes have been read and written
/// as [totalReadCount] and [totalWriteCount].
///
/// # Streaming
/// Codec buffers are read and write streamable.
/// The stream is considered to be [atEnd] when [readCount] == [writeCount]
/// and there are no bytes to read.
/// The stream is considered to be [isFull] when [writeCount] == [length]
